General information about MxOrbulent. Edgy on purpose.


MxOrbulent is the place where you go to cry, laugh and hopefully not get triggered.
Censorship is not my cup of tea and I try to avoid that to the greatest possible extent.
But for the sake of stroking the e-peen of easily offended "Adults need nappy and daycare" people
on github, let's keep the MxOrbulent Github repositories free of "controversial" content.

The purpose is simple, when MxOrbulent.space decides to be nice and release plugins, code, scripts etc to the public, then a repository will be created for that project under this account.

The code will be released as CC0 - Creative Commons (UNLESS I AM FORCED TO USE ANOTHER LICENSE, FOR EXAMPLE PORTING SOMEONE ELSES CODE ETC)
If you have not seen this readme in a long time, you will notice that alot of things have changed in it, that is because A: I'm back bitches.
B: I have moved away from the "Bukkit" family entirely. I will not support them at all because of the draconian GPL licenses, which fucking suck ass.

## Why is GPL crap?

GPL is a subversive piece of shit license where the goal is a effectively a communistic digital library of software.
One might be tricked into thinking it provides freedom to the ones who license their software under it, but it actually does not.
What you are doing is contributing to a repressive enviroment that is literally no better than whatever "capitalistic swine" you claim to oppose.

I've never been one to properly put words on things sometimes, but I think this best sums up my toughts about it.

Not to mention that GNU GPL severely limits my ability to earn money. 
FSF and stallman are absolutely delusional about IRL. Stallman especially since he's quite literally the biggest freeloader in the world

Unless you have a massive project (in terms of numbers of users), you will never earn a liveable wage (in my country liveable is no less than 
1000 USD after taxes, and we have very high taxes).
For a example of how few donators you will actually get, (and using a estimated guess) Linux Mint has 150 000 active users.
Out of these, a mere 336 users so far at this month of writing (2021 June 27) have donated a combined total of 8052 USD.
That's a pitifully small amount compared to how many people use the project in some form or another. Some 0,00224% donated. LOL
Linux Mint has sponsors who probably provide 3-4 times as many. And you are not going to get sponsored unless you are a large project.

## What do you suggest instead?
Use the MIT License, CC0 license or any other license that releases into the public domain properly.
Or make it closed source. Don't use some communistic half-way point like GNU GPL that completely fuck your ability to earn your daily bread over
and the same ability for others. GNU LGPL is "better" but still a far cry from what I consider freedom.

Releasing it into the public domain ensures you can release code as you please without having your projects be fucked up because you included code. It is the ultimate freedom.
Another company cannot legally forbid you from using code already released under MIT etc, but still allows them to properly include it into their bussnies without getting their whole project fucked. And they can at any moment they choose give back by released any improvements back into public domain.

Or in other words: GNU GPL holds a gun to your face. Don't do that to others.
