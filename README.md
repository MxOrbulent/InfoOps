General information about MxOrbulent. Edgy on purpose.


MxOrbulent is the place where you go to cry, laugh and hopefully not get triggered.
Censorship is not my cup of tea and I try to avoid that to the greatest possible extent.
But for the sake of stroking the e-peen of easily offended "Adults need nappy and daycare" people
on github, let's keep the MxOrbulent Github repositories free of "controversial" content.

The purpose is simple, when MxOrbulent.space decides to be nice and release plugins, code, scripts etc to the public, then a repository will be created for that project under this account.

Code will be released under either MIT or LGPL.

**Why not GPL, WHY "insert license that allows you to use the project in properitary software"? "MUH BEARDED COMMIE STALLMAN HEIL STALLMAN REEE"**

While I do admire some parts of stallmans ideology and his drive (besides toe nail eating, shower once in a while you autist), he's unironically adding the same limits with GPL that normal properitary
software does (hypocrite). If I link a GPL library and compile with it, the entire project goes under GPL.
Yes, I can sell the software. But once someone demands the source code, I am legally obligated to give it over to whoever requested it. Unobfuscated I might add too and without unreasonable delay.

When I do this, they can simply upload the source code, and there goes my revenue down the shitter. 
You are sadly mistaken if you think it's easy to start something up and just spend a bunch of free time on it.
Money makes the world go around. But communism throws you into the gulag.

Only large projects will ever see a sustainable stream of donations to cover salaries and expenses.
And I'm pretty sure that less than 10% of your lifetime visitors ever will donate. Out of those maybe half will be regulars.
GPL licensing is not sunstainable for startups pretty much in my opinion.

While I don't intend to make money on things I release to the public, I am trying to think off both open source
AND properitary makers. That's why either MIT, Public Domain OR LGPL are the only acceptable alternatives.
Especially LGPL is a nice compromise because it only demands that the source code that is licensed under LGPL to be
released while keeping the rest of the software intact (and safe from commies). This forces the company to provide source for LGPL licensed parts of their own project. And at the same time 
it allows them to protect their own code that is not licensed under LGPL (like other parts of the project).

**To that end, DO NOT ASK US TO LICENSE PROJECTS UNDER GPL, OR INFACT DO NOT ASK US TO USE X LICENSE OVERALL. WE DECIDE WHAT LICENSE GOES ONTO THE REPOSITORY AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE CODE. END OF STORY**
