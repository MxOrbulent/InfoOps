General information about MxOrbulent. Edgy on purpose.


MxOrbulent is the place where you go to cry, laugh and hopefully not get triggered.
Censorship is not my cup of tea and I try to avoid that to the greatest possible extent.
But for the sake of stroking the e-peen of easily offended "Adults need nappy and daycare" people
on github, let's keep the MxOrbulent Github repositories free of "controversial" content.

The purpose is simple, when MxOrbulent.space decides to be nice and release plugins, code, scripts etc to the public, then a repository will be created for that project under this account.

The code will be released as CC0 - Creative Commons.
If you have not seen this readme in a long time, you will notice that alot of things have changed in it, that is because A: I'm back bitches.
B: I have moved away from the "Bukkit" family entirely. I will not support them at all because of the draconian GPL licenses, which fucking suck ass.
